# 🌱 Totem – Culturally Safe Medication Support App  

## 📖 Project Description  
**Totem** is a mobile health app co-designed with Aboriginal perspectives to address the urgent challenge of **medication non-adherence among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples**.  

Instead of framing medicines as “Western tablets,” the app uses **biomimicry and Indigenous knowledge systems** to re-embed medicine into the cycles of **nature, mob, and Country**. By blending cultural symbols, storytelling, and collective care, Totem transforms adherence from a confusing medical routine into a meaningful act of connection.

## 🩺 The Problem  
Medication non-adherence in Aboriginal communities is driven by cultural, structural, and personal barriers:  

- **Cultural & Historical Factors**  
  - Mistrust of Western medicine, forced removals, systemic racism in healthcare.  
  - Preference for traditional healing practices.  
  - Holistic view of health vs narrow Western framing.  

- **Access & Structural Barriers**  
  - Remoteness: hours from nearest pharmacy or GP.  
  - Transport & cost challenges for scripts/refills.  
  - Supply disruptions in rural pharmacies.  

- **Communication & Understanding**  
  - 150+ Aboriginal languages, with English often a second/third language.  
  - Low health literacy & confusing medical jargon.  
  - Side effects poorly explained → leads to fear and stopping treatment.  

- **Personal & Social Factors**  
  - Polypharmacy: 5–10 pills daily, overwhelming and tiring.  
  - Stigma around certain medications (mental health, diabetes, HIV).  
  - Family/community obligations taking priority.  
  - Fatalism: illness seen as inevitable.  

The result is preventable illness, shorter life expectancy, and higher health system pressure.

## 🌿 The Solution: Biomimicry & Culture  

### 🔑 Nature Inspiration  
- **Seasons & Cycles** → Aboriginal knowledge systems are based on natural cycles.  
- **Totem Animals & Kinship** → Strong connections between people, animals, and Country.  
- **Collective Care (the Mob)** → Survival in nature comes from the group looking out for each other.

### A. Medicine as Nature Strength  
- Each medication maps to a natural element or totem animal.  
- Taking a dose strengthens that element (💧 river fills, 🐢 turtle grows).  
- Missed doses cause the element to weaken.  
👉 Transforms adherence into **caring for self, mob, and Country**.  

---

### B. Cycles, Not Clocks  
- Reminders align with natural cycles instead of fixed times:  
  - 🌅 Sunrise dose  
  - 🌞 Midday dose  
  - 🌄 Sunset dose  
  - 🌙 Night dose  
👉 Aligns health with rhythms of sun, moon, and seasons.  

---

### C. Mob Support  
- With permission, family see **nature-coded signals** (never clinical data):  
  - “Nan’s river is flowing.”  
  - “Grandad’s turtle is strong.”  
👉 Builds accountability through collective care while protecting dignity.  

---

### D. Storytelling Mode  
- Simple audio-visual stories explain medicines with cultural metaphors:  
  - “This pill is like firewood — it keeps your fire burning.”  
  - “These tablets are like rain — they wash sugar from your blood.”  
👉 Bridges literacy and language barriers with **oral storytelling**.
